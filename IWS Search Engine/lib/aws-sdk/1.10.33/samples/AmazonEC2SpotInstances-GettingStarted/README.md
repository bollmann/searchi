This is a sample that demonstrates how to set up requests for Spot Instances, how to determine when they have completed, and how to clean up afterwards.

## Prerequisites

*   You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account.
*   Requires the AWS SDK for Java. For more information on the AWS SDK for Java, see [http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava](http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava).
*   You must be signed up to use Amazon EC2. For more information on Amazon EC2, see [http://aws.amazon.com/EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2).

## Running the Sample

The basic steps for running the Amazon EC2 Spot Instance Getting Started sample are:

1.  Create a credentials file in the location ~/.aws with name "credentials".

2.  Under the `default` profile fill in your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:

  ```
  [default]
  aws_access_key_id =
  aws_secret_access_key =
  ```

3.  Save the file.

4.  Run the `CreateSecurityGroupApp.java` file, located in the same directory as the properties file. To use ant to run the file, type "ant CreateSecurityGroupApp"

5.  Run the `GettingStartedApp.java` file, located in the same directory as the properties file. The sample prints information to the standard output. To use ant to run the file, type "ant GettingStartedApp"

**NOTE:** The sample also includes an Ant build.xml file to run the sample.
